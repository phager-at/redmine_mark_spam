= Redmine Mark Spam 

This little plugin provides context menu options to mark multiple tickets as
spam or as outdated tickets (i.e. Monitoring Tickets which can be replaced by a newer ticket).

It sets them to 100%, assigns the current user,
changes status to a status which can be set in configuration and adds a standardized comment!
